# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-RELIABLE-NETWORK-TRANSPORT-PROTOCOLS
• Design, testing and implementation of custom Transport layer protocols based on Alternating bit, Go back-N &amp; Selective repeat for reliable data transfer under a simulated network environment. • Performance analysis is done by comparing the variations in loss probability with increasing throughput.
